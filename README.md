## General Information
- Provide general information about your project here.
  - Sample code used to access an industry standard RESTful API.  
- What problem does it (intend to) solve?
  - Code snipits can be used to accelerate development of mobile applications.
- What is the purpose of your project?
  - The goal was to help developers build mobile apps faster by reducing their learning curve.
- Why did you undertake it?
  - ACRIS is an important informaiton sharing resource for the airport industry.
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->
## Technologies Used
- Xcode=13.4
- Swift=5.5
- IOS=15.5
- ACRIS-AGIM-Concessions-and-Seamless-Travel=2.0
## Features
List the ready features here:
- Illustrates four RESTfull interfaces
  - airportservices/v2/airports/servicecategories/
  - airportservices/v2/airports/services/servicecategories/{service_category_id}/
  - airportservices/v2/airports/{airport_code}/services/servicecategories/{service_category_id}/
  - airportservices/v2/references/airports/{iata_code}/queues/
- Contains examples of conversion from JSON raw data to Swift useable data structures
- Very simple IOS application
## Screenshots

<!-- If you have screenshots you'd like to share, include them here. -->
## Architecture

<!-- If you have screenshots you'd like to share, include them here. -->
## Setup
What are the project requirements/dependencies? Where are they listed? A requirements.txt or a Pipfile.lock file perhaps? Where is it located?
- git clone the publi repository 
```
git clone https://github.com/parttimehacker/services_portal.git
```
## Usage
I recommend extracting code segments from the repository to prototype future mobile applications. The most important code examples are the interface classes that extract JSON data from the ACRIS API.
- NetworkSingleton.swift
- ServiceCategoriesSingleton.swift
- ServiceOfferingSingleton.swift
## Implementation Status
![Status](https://progress-bar.dev/60/?title=progress)
## Room for Improvement
Include areas you believe need improvement / could be improved. Also add TODOs for future development.
- Further refactoring to more generalize the application
- Test the downloading and cloning of the repository to see if it works correctly?!?
